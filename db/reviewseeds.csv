“5”,“3”,“3”,“Liked everything about this BBQ. Just had to put handle on lid and fit grill. Great size cooking plate easily feed 4. Used several times already and so easy to clean.”,,,,
“5”,“4”,“4”,“Excellent barbi best one on the market”,,,,
“5”,“5”,“5”,"“Solid barbecue performance, well built, Cooks well, food tastes good. Would be 5 stars except there is no warming rack or dual burner control so no way to have a cooler section of the bbq.”",,,,
“5”,“6”,“6”,"“Had it for 6 weeks now. Done burgers, sausage and several steaks. Follow the instructions and let it heat up. It's worth the wait. Like all BBQ machines, it's a bitch to clean! Helps you become the grilling God you always knew you were. Recommended”",,,,
“5”,“7”,“7”,"“Nothing to dislike, it’ a good bbq.”",,,,
“3”,“8”,“8”,"“I have had a Weber before and this one was more expensive so was surprised when it didn’t have wheels, and it’s quite flimsy. However it’s easier to clean than the old one.”",,,,

“5”,“10”,“10”,"“Did a BBQ, did the job. Family loved it”",,,,
“4”,“11”,“11”,"“Just got back into bbqs after a few years and didn't want to spend a lot on a bbq just in case it was a bad idea so this is ideal for me and my wife, perfect size for the two of us”",,,,
“1,“12”,“1”,“Bought this in the summer as a housewarming gift for my daughter and her student mates. Came to put it together for bonfire night and there are screws missing. Easily fixed but no good on the night when they wanted to use it. So can’t give this a very high score”, even if I did think it was a good buy.”,,,
“2”,“13”,“2”,“Couldn't assemble as half the screws etc missing. Would have been great otherwise”,,,,
“4”,“14”,“3”,“Good size easy to put together good value for money”,,,,
“3”,“15”,“4”,"“Previous bbq broke & wanted a small one quick, this was better value than most, delivered the next day & does what we need it for. Much better than wasting money buying lots of disposable ones.”",,,,
“3”,“1”,“5”,“Seller now informs me they don’t hold spares for this item”, and I should have informed them of the missing screws within 5 days of arrival ! As this was a gift that doesn’t really work. Not helpful.”,,,
“1”,“2”,“6”,“Wanted a budget bbq until I can afford a proper one next year. This was a pain to assemble”, diagrams were not very big and it was unclear which nuts and bolts to use. It is fairly cheaply constructed And not very tall but with that said it worked ok. I don’t expect it to last long but for the money it does the job.”,,,
“2”,“3”,“7”,"“First time ever bbq-ing and not having burnt food! I've always used the disposable ones which seems to burn food, this set did take ages to cook so might need more coal than I put in. Fiddly to build”",,,,
“3”,“5”,“9”,"“This is a very small BBQ. However, you shouldn't expect anything more. The product is of the level that you should expect for the price.”",,,,
“4”,“6”,“10”,“Just the perfect size for home barbecue. Easy to assemble. Lightweight to lift. Very happy with purchase”,,,,
“4”,“7”,“11”,“Good product easy to assemble. Would recommend. If only Amazon could give you a delivery time as I had to wait in all day.”,,,,

“3”,“10”,“3”,"“Arrival day early, not to difficult to put together, fairly sturdy. Ok for garden get together.”",,,,
“4”,“11”,“4”,“Excellent bbq. I was really impressed with the quality at this price. Really quite stable and rigid. It worked well and after one big bbq was undamaged. I used tin foil in the bottom”, as the instructions said - no rusting ”,,,
“5”,“12”,“5”,"“Easy to assemble , great size for the family”",,,,
“4”,“13”,“6”,“This is a neat little BBQ that does the job. Have used it twice and no issues so far.”,,,,
“1”,“14”,“7”,“The quality is not very good”,,,,
“2”,“15”,“8”,“The bottom vent doesn't stay close to the frame”, so hot coals always drip out. When assembling, when you tighten the screws, porcelain comes off and becomes scalpel-sharp shards of glass. It is the right size for 2 people. It is as small as a portable one, but not really small enough to be portable.”
“2”,“16”,“9”,“If all you want is a basic BBQ and replace it every 2 yrs then this is fit for purpose. But what do you expect at this price. Nice area to cook on.”,,,,
“3”,“1”,“10”,“Better than expected. Assembly is not 5 minutes”, but not difficult if you have IQ bigger than a lettuce's. Instructions very good. Used it twice without problem, construction and feeling is sturdy. Left it out for a few weeks totally exposed to weather conditions without problems. Very pleased”,,
“4”,“2”,“11”,"“Despatched in good time and assembling was quite easy. The finished product seems solid and robust and good value,unfortunately the weather has not been good enough for me to use yet.”",,,,
“1”,“3”,“1”,"“Some parts were missing, The lid handle,some assembly screws which was quite disappointing as kids were looking forward to having a barbecue that weekend. I couldn’t return because kids ripped package.”",,,,
“1”,“4”,“2”,“Took ages to assemble as instructions were terrible and pictures did not match the product.”,,,,
“4”,“5”,“3”,"“Bigger than expected and plenty of cooking space just make sure it's on an even surface, I stand mine in 2 paving slabs, it's a good buy”",,,,

“5”,“7”,“5”,“Great bbq!!!! Easy to use !!!”,,,,
“5”,“8”,“6”,“really very good in all respects.i assembled it in 90 mins whilst sat in a wheelchair. tested it and it performed well.thanks.”,,,,
“1”,“9”,“7”,“This is the worst product i have ever bought from Amazon. Very cheaply made. material is awfully thin. one handle is missing. very unstable after assembled. If you pay 20 eu more”, you could buy a decent one in shop. even with this price you can buy a much much better one in lidl.”,,,
“1”,“10”,“8”,"“BAD…Very bad quality, short height, if I could get it for free I wouldn’t even take it.”",,,,

“3”,“4”,“7”,“What do you want more for this price?!”,,,,
“3”,“5”,“8”,“Really poor quality item. Very thin. Unlikely to last long at all. Wobbly wheel. If you're above 5ft2 you're likely to get backache as this thing is tiny. Very disappointed.”,,,,
“4”,“6”,“9”,“For the money it's a great BBQ”,,,,
